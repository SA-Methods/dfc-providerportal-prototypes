Apprentices will also complete The Care Certificate standards. Our industry qualified and experienced Skills Tutors will provide a learning activity for the apprentice every month. This will involve the use of our e-learning portal (Learning Assistant) and visits to the workplace for the Skills Tutor to perform support and observations to build a portfolio of evidence."
