    <p class="govuk-body">You can upload a CSV file to update multiple venues in Publish to the course directory.  If you are completing a venue data upload for the first time we recommend you take the following steps:</p>

    <strong>Download your published venue data</strong>
    <br>
    This will ensure all your existing venues and venue references will be included in the data file.
    <p></p>

    <strong>Add new venues to your file</strong>
    <br>
    Follow the file format requirements for each of the fields.
    <p></p>

    <strong>Add a venue reference</strong>
    <br>
    An existing venue reference should not be edited or removed.
    <p></p>

    <strong>Removing a venue from a data upload</strong>
    <br>
    You can remove a venue from your data upload by deleting all data within the row.
    <p></p>
    You should not remove a venue from your data file that is linked to a course.  Removing a venue from your data file that is linked to a course will be added when publishing to Publish to the course directory.
    <p></p>

    <strong>Edit or delete a venue that is linked to a course</strong>
    <br>
    You will need to edit or delete the the courses by selecting view and edit from the <a href="#" class="govuk-link">homescreen</a>
